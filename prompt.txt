{db[app_name]["prompt"]}
API Call (indexes are zero-indexed):
{api_call}
Database State:
{db[app_name]["state"]}
Output the API response as json prefixed with '!API response!:'. Then output the new database state as json, prefixed with '!New Database State!:'. If the API call is only requesting data, then don't change the database state, but base your 'API Response' off what's in the database.
